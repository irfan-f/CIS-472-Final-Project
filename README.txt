Final Project Code

The project code folder contains:

final.py -- This file contains all code for implmenting, training, tuning, and analyzing the logistic regression and k-nearest neighbors classifiers.
            As the file exists currently, all classifiers will be executed and the scores for tuning models will be printed followed by the accuracy of the best model(best parameter).

            To execute the code enter,

            Suggested:
            python3 final.py
            
            python final.py (may be sufficient, but relies on user computer organization)

high_diamond_ranked_10min.csv -- Contains all data from the kaggle dataset, https://www.kaggle.com/bobbyscience/league-of-legends-diamond-ranked-games-10-min.
                                 This data is parsed and used for implementing the classifiers.
